<h1>Why I Love the Command Line</h1>
<p>It didn't start out that way. I always saw the command line as the
 scary thing that popped up in the terminal on my mac. I didn't get why using it
would be any better than clicking through things like I normally did.
But, I truly didn't understand its purpose, or its power. After my time in
INFO 201 at The University of Washington, I slowly began to appreciate what it
could do for me.</p>
<p>It started out with Git. It was eye opening to see how the simple looking
terminal on my computer to interact with files stored on a more advanced website
such as GitHub. With a few keystrokes, I could remotely update files and check
the status of their updates. Pretty intuitive. As long as I remembered what to
type, I could do cool things, which wasn't always easy. </p>
<p>In casual use, my favorite property of the command line is to create files
with the touch command. The ability to name a file type to a specific location
before even open it is useful and helps for organization. It is easy to create
placeholder files for later editing.</p>
<p>Lastly, whenever I use commands within the command line, it makes me feel
like I know what I'm doing, which is a feeling that is hard to achieve sometimes
as a student. Whatever makes me feel better about myself...</p>
